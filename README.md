# Readout erro mitigated quantum state tomographty (REMQST)
This is the code base used to perform readout error mitigation for the project assosiated to the publication: [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-024-01790-8).

A tutorial notebook is provided that shows how to run REMQST with examples of how to create your own simulations and also loading in data from previous runs.  
There are examples of other applications, such as extracting spesific basis states from detector tomography and compute the standard deviation of the BME infidelities.
