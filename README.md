# Readout erro mitigated quantum state tomographty (REMQST)
This is the code base used to perform readout error mitigation for the project assosiated to the publication: [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04211).

A tutorial notebook of how to run REMQST is provided with examples of how to create your own simulations and also loading in data from previous runs.
